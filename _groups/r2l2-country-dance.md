We are proud to be the only NTA certified dance instructors in the Treasure Valley. NTA is an organization for improving the quality of dance instruction to enable teachers to provide more evocative instruction in the art and practice of Country Western Dancing.

To keep our teaching current we also travel throughout the year to various dance events to learn from the country's best trained professionals. Our goal is to provide you with the latest and best dance instruction to get you out on the social dance floor. We provide private & group instruction in country swing, 2-step, east coast swing, west coast swing, patterns, line and more. Check out our website pages for more information. Join us for a lesson or dance and you'll see that we're in it for the fun of dancing!
