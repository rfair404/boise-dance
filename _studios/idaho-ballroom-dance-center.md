The Idaho Ballroom Dance Center is owned by Martha Pohl.

Martha Pohl was born and raised in Munich, Germany. The daugher of Czech and Latvian immigrants, she started dancing ballet and jazz at age four and eventually found herself attracted to the world of ballroom dance, which she has dedicated herself to ever since. After 11 years owning and operating a Fred Astaire Franchised studio in Huntsville, Alabama, she moved to Boise where she has been since 1994. Her goal is to bring the benefits of ballroom dance to the Treasure Valley.
